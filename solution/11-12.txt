1. create 2 vm
2. open tools/network/, goto natnetwork, click create, check ip there.
3. start both vm, check their ip by ifconfig (if not working sudo apt install net-tools)
4. Enable SSH:
	Ensure that SSH (Secure Shell) is enabled on both the source and destination VMs. SSH is typically pre-installed on most Linux distributions.
	If SSH is not installed, install it by running the following command:
		sudo apt install openssh-server
	Enable SSH by starting the SSH service:
		sudo service ssh start
5. scp file.txt username@ipadd: (vm2@172.168.2.5):
